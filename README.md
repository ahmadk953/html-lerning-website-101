# My HTML Lerning Website

## About

This is my html learning website. You can use this as a template repo. I used to use this repo to learn HTMl, CSS, and JavaScript but now, I have moved on from using pure HTML to using libraries like Next.js and React.

## Where to find my website?

Here is the link to the [main version of the website](https://my-html-learning-website.onrender.com/)
