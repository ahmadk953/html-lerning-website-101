# My HTML Lerning Website
## About
This is my html learning website. You can use this as a template repo.
The "Dev" branch is updated when I make a new change to my website. The "Main" branch is updated when the "Dev" branch is fully stable.
## Where to find my website?
Here is a link to the production version of the website: https://my-html-learning-website.onrender.com/
