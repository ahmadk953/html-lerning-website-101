# My HTML Lerning Website
# Important ⚠️
## **Just to let everyone know ahead of time, I will be permenently re-woking the website and I will slowly start to migrate this project to a Node.js application. Most of the features shoud and will stay the same but some stuff will get re-woked or maybe even removed (ex. php pages).**
